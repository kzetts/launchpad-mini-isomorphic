# Isomorphic custom modes for Novation Launchpad Mini MK3

The [Novation Launchpad Mini MK3](https://novationmusic.com/en/launch/launchpad-mini) is a very good box with a very dumb default keys layout.

By default, it stacks 4 octaves in a piano-ish layout

I'm a fan of [isomorphic keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_keyboard)(example: [deluge](https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/), [linnstrument](https://www.rogerlinndesign.com/linnstrument)), and while this mode exists in the Launchpad X, it doesn't seem to have made its way to the mini.

In this repo there are 2 `.syx` files for custom modes, to be loaded with [Novation Components](https://components.novationmusic.com/).

The scales are from C2-C6 in both major and minor key.

#### C2-C6 Major
